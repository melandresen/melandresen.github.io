In my research, I work with methods of corpus linguistics and computational linguistics, like annotation, statistical analysis, and machine learning. I love that these methods have possible applications in almost all areas of text based research. Here are some of the research fields I have been working on:


# Computational Literary Studies

I am part of the project [Q:TRACK](https://quadrama.github.io/) that is funded as part of the DFG priority program “Computational Literary Studies”. We work in quantitative drama analysis and currently focus on character knowledge about character relations. For many dramas the flow of information is key, for instance: When does the protagonist discover that her lover is, unfortunately, also her brother?

In an earlier project in Hamburg, [hermA](https://www.herma.uni-hamburg.de/), I was involved in work on how coreference annotation influences network analysis of literary text.


# Academic Language

I became interested in academic language when I worked as a peer tutor at my university's writing center as a graduate student. In my PhD thesis, I investigated differences in the academic languages of literary studies and linguistics. My focus was on how these differences can be identified in a data-driven approach. 

During my time at the writing center in Hamburg, I was also involved in the creation of the learner corpus [KoLaS](https://doi.org/10.25592/uhhfdm.8322). The corpus comprises texts from students that visited the writing center and therefore includes many different text types, disciplines and language backgrounds. Specifically, text comments by peer tutors are also available. Subsequently, we did some analyses on the use of *ich* (‘I’) in academic language and in learner data specifically.


# Data reuse, reproducibility and replication

I am in favor of the publication of data and scripts that were created for research, so studies become reproducible and data can be reused in follow-up studies. For this purpose, I use [GitHub](https://github.com/melandresen) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). Replication studies are a great way of testing whether the results from one study can be generalized beyond the data under investigation. In the project [XSample](https://www.izus.uni-stuttgart.de/fokus/fdm-projekte/xsample/), we explore options for sharing corpus data that is protected by copyright law.
