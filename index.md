I am a data engineer at DeepL, working on the improvement of machine translation. 
Until 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher in corpus linguistics and computational linguistics at the [Institute for Natural Language Processing](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the University of Stuttgart. In interdisciplinary projects, I investigated how methods from corpus linguistics and computational linguistics can contribute to all kinds of text-related research in the humanities. I have also taught courses in the Master's program in digital humanities and have published a [textbook on computational linguistic methods for the digital humanities][https://www.narr.de/computerlinguistische-methoden-f%C3%BCr-die-digital-humanities-18579-1/].
